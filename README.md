# Today I Learned
A website where users can read and share about new and interesting things they have learned

## TODO
- Implement search feature (Algolia?)
- Implement Hacker News ranking algorithm:
    - Implement point system:
        - Users must only be able to vote once on a post
        - Button must dissapear after voting, but must not require the page to reload (look for simplest solution)
- Implement colorscheme
