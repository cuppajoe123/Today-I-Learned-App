# Today I Learned
A website where users can read and share about new and interesting things they have learned

## TODO
- Fine tune search feature
- Implement colorscheme

Test data is loaded from submission-bodies.json and submission-titles.json.
Currently, the first 45 records are used and uploaded to Algolia for search
functionality. If the amount of test data is changed, the Algolia index will
also need to be changed.
