        <h1>About</h1>
        <p class="bodytext">Today I Learned XYZ is a website where users can document the interesting
          things they learn, either from hobbies or jobs. Users can also read and vote on
          the submissions of other users, based on how interesting and useful the
          submission is. To stay updated on the findings of the most interesting users,
          RSS feeds are available.</p>
        <h2>Why I built this</h2>
        <p class="bodytext">I built Today I Learned XYZ to learn more about full stack web
        development, as well as infrastructure and software engineering in
        general. However, I wanted whatever software I made to be useful, with a
        more specific purpose than just a generic blogging platform. Before
        starting the project, I saw this post on Hacker News:
        <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/">What To Blog About</a>.
        I found particularly interesting the section about Today I Learned style
        blog posts, in which the author writes about new findings that interest
        them. The TIL format is mostly for the benefit of the author, as the
        subject can be something that has already been covered in other blogs.
        All that matters was that the author learned something new and wants to
        share about it, for the benefit of others. I thought this would be a
        refreshing change of pace from social networking sites where users are
        constantly trying to make the most popular content.</p>
